playlists which means in addition torecommending individual songs, Rythmiq could be expanded to provide personalized playlists based on auser's music preferences and listening
habits.This could involve developing new algorithms and featuresto allow for more personalized and dynamic playlists. Social media integration can also be done. The project
could be expanded to include social media integration, allowing users to share their listeninghabits and recommendations with friends and followers on social media platforms.
