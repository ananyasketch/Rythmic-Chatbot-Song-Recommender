# Rythmic-Chatbot-Song-Recommender

It is rightly said that “Music can heal wounds that medicine cannot touch” but it can create more chaos if it is not related to one’s mood. Music has been an integral part of human life since ancient times. Rythmiq is an innovative web-based application that aims to solve this problem. It provides personalized music recommendations based on user preferences, moods, and interests. The application offers several features that help users discover music that suits them. The music library feature provides a vast selection
of songs that users can search by genre, artist, and album. The chatbot feature analyzes users' preferences and provides personalized music recommendations based on their responses.

# Future Works 

There are several potential avenues for future work that could be pursued in order to build on the Rythmiq project. Some potential areas of focus could include personalized playlists which means in addition to recommending individual songs, Rythmiq could be expanded to provide personalized playlists based on a user's music preferences and listening habits.This could involve developing new algorithms and features to allow for more personalized and dynamic playlists. Social media integration can also be done. The
project could be expanded to include social media integration, allowing users to share their listening habits and recommendations with friends and followers on social media platforms. This could help to increase the system's visibility and user base, as well as provide additional opportunities for engagementand interaction between users.
